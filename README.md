I'm a versatile developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, including Python, JavaScript, PHP, Terraform, Docker, HTML, and CSS. My toolkit also includes frameworks like Django, Flask, React, Vue, and CakePHP. 
<br>

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Systems from the National University of La Plata. During my time there, I worked as a teaching assistant and researcher for two years. My thesis, which won multiple awards, was published as a paper in Springer.

I'm passionate about programming and constantly strive to deepen my knowledge and skills. I thrive on new challenges, learn quickly, and enjoy working collaboratively in team environments.
